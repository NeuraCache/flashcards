# Goal

This repository aims to standardize the creation of Flashcards and cards for Spaced Repetition in Markdown files.

## Use Cases

- Create Portable decks of flashcards and cards for spaced repetition.
- Include flashcards and spaced repetition cards in notes (in tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))
- Non intrusive flashcards in GitHub README.md files to facilitate the retention of key concepts.

## Quick Example

How many people are bitten by snakes each year? : 5.3M ‚ö°Ô∏è

How many people die each year from snake bites? : ~130k ‚ö°Ô∏è

See gif below for an example review of üëÜ cards in [NeuraCache](https://neuracache.com/)

# Specification

## One-Line Cards

### One-Line Flashcards
```
question : answer #flashcard #optionaltag1 #optionaltag2
```

**Example:**
```
‚å•‚èé : follow link #flashcard #intellij #shortkeys
```
### One-Line Spaced Repetition
```
content #spaced #optionaltag1 #optionaltag2
```
**Example:**
```
"We are what we repeadetly do" #spaced
```
## Micro Cards

Same as "One-Line Flashcards" but instead of a #flashcard you can use ‚ö°Ô∏è or üß†
This is great for Github README.md files where a #flashcard could look strange.

**Example:**
```
‚å•‚èé: follow link ‚ö°Ô∏è
```
## Regular Cards

Regular cards allow creating cards with images, latex, lists, etc.

A horizontal rule is used to mark the end of the card.

You can use: 

\-\-\-, \- \- \-, \*\*\*, \* \* \*
