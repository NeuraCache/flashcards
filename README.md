# Goal

This repository aims to standardize the creation of Flashcards and cards for Spaced Repetition in Markdown files.

## Use Cases

- Create Portable decks of flashcards and cards for spaced repetition.
- Include flashcards and spaced repetition cards in notes (in tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/))
- Non intrusive flashcards in GitHub README.md files to facilitate the retention of key concepts.

## Quick Example

How many people are bitten by snakes each year? : 5.3M ‚ö°Ô∏è

How many people die each year from snake bites? : ~130k ‚ö°Ô∏è

See gif below for an example review of üëÜ cards in [NeuraCache](https://neuracache.com/)

**Example:**

#spaced #quotes
- "We are what we repeadetly do" Will Durant
- ‚ÄúBe yourself; everyone else is already taken.‚Äù Oscar Wilde

## Micro Cards

Same as "One-Line Flashcards" but instead of a #flashcard you can use ‚ö°Ô∏è or üß†
This is great for Github README.md files where a #flashcard could look strange.

**Example:**

**‚å•‚èé**: follow link ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Regular Cards

Regular cards allow creating cards with images, latex, lists, etc.

A horizontal rule is used to mark the end of the card.

You can use: 

\-\-\-, \- \- \-, \*\*\*, \* \* \*

### Regular Flashcards
question #flashcard #optionaltag1 #optionaltag2

**Example:**

Radii of stable orbits in the Bohr model #flashcard 

$a_0  = \frac{{ \hbar ^2}}{{m_e ke^2}}$

$\Delta E = h\nu$

$c = \lambda \nu$
